INTERVIEW CAKE Array Slicing
———————————————

- Array slicing involves taking a subset from an array and allocating a new array with those elements

- In Java you can create a new array of the elements in myArray from startIndex to endIndex (exclusive) like this:

Arrays.copyOfRange(myArray, startIndex, endIndex);

- Pretty convenient right? But there is something you should be aware of. There is a hidden time and space cost here,  while slicing might seem like you are just grabbing elements, it is actually doing two things:
	
	1. Allocating memory for a new array 							O(n) Space complexity
	2. Copying the elements from the original array to the new array	O(n) runtime

- These two steps are taking O(n) space and time complexity where n is the resulting arrays size

- Its a bit easier to realize it when you are saving the result as a variable

int[ ] tailOfArray = Arrays.copyOfRange(myArray, 1, myArray.length);
